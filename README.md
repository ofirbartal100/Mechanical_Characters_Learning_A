# Mechanical Characters Learning A

This project is a side tool to the Mechanical Characters project

Here you can train the weigths of A with an iterative interface

For using this app you need to compile with VS2017.
Also when running for the first time an error should occure, saying you need to define the paths for your Python, and Script files.

The script is in the other git project "Mechanical Characters Project" => "generate_random_curve_for_learning_A.py"
